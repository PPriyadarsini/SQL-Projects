# Decode Gaming Behaviour with SQL
Explored a dataset related to a game with SQL as part of the "Mentorness" internship project, consisting of the 'Player Details' and 'Level Details' tables. Through a series of SQL queries, I uncovered valuable insights from this dataset, answering 15 questions that delve into various aspects of player performance and game progression.

## Dataset Description

## Rules of the Game
1) Players play a game divided into 3-levels (L0,L1 and L2)
2) Each level has 3 difficulty levels (Low,Medium,High)
3) At each level,players have to kill the opponents using guns/physical fight
4) Each level has multiple stages at each difficulty level.
5) A player can only play L1 using its system generated L1_code.
6) Only players who have played Level1 can possibly play Level2 using its system generated L2_code.
7) By default a player can play L0.
8) Each player can login to the game using a Dev_ID.
9) Players can earn extra lives at each stage in a level.
